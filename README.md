# Udacity-Dog-App
Dog App for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree (2019)

The goal for this project was to develop an alogirthm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app with the intent to be able to identify whether an image is a human or a dog. If the image is a dog, the goal is to be able to identify what dog breed. 

A convolutional neural network is built using two different methodologies:

 1. Create a CNN from scratch
 2. Create a CNN using transfer learning

The end of the project supplies some example input images. The output from the classifer was okay. With the parameters given in this notebook, it didn't perform as well as I would have expected. However, it was interesting to note that when the image had more than one person, it seemed like the model became confused.
